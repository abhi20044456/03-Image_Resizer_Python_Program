# Image Resizer using OpenCV

## Introduction
This project is a simple image resizer tool created using Python and the OpenCV library. The program allows users to input an image file, specify the percentage by which they want to reduce the image size, and save the resized image with a new name.

## Features
- Resizes an image based on the percentage input provided by the user.
- Saves the resized image with the desired file name and location.
- Uses the OpenCV library to handle image operations.

## How it Works
1. The user provides the path to the original image.
2. The user specifies the percentage by which they want to reduce the image size.
3. The program resizes the image based on the input dimensions and saves it with a new name provided by the user.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
You need Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required library:

1. Install Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)
2. Install OpenCV using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
## Steps to Run the Project
- Clone the repository:
- Run the Python script:
 
## Follow the prompts to enter:
-Image path: Path to the original image.
- Save name: Name for the resized image.
- Reduce percentage: The percentage to reduce the image size (e.g., enter 50 to reduce the image by 50%).

## Learning Experience
This project helped me understand:

- How to use the OpenCV library to read, resize, and save images.
- Basic file handling and user input in Python.
- Performing mathematical calculations to adjust image dimensions dynamically.
